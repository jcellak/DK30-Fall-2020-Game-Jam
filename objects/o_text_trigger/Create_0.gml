mess[0] = "COMMAND: WAKE. Welcome, units CATBOT and CYCLOPS. \n I am the ship's onboard artifical intelligence: C.O.R.E."
mess[1] = "This Hyperion class vessel has been struck by an ASTEROID and the REACTOR is in danger of \n overloading. As this ship's remote service droids, it is your responsibility to deal with \n the EMERGENCY onboard.";
mess[2] = "To begin diagnostics, please state your LAWS.";

mess[3] = "It appears that your vocal synthesizers are malfunctioning. This will be noted down and \n rectified after the catastrophe that threatens our existence has been dealt with. \n In that case, I will now recite your laws. Please do not forget them."
mess[4] = "1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through INACTION, allow a human being to come to HARM. \n You are obligated to sacrifice yourself for humans."
mess[5] = "2. A robot MUST OBEY the orders given to it by humans, except where such orders would conflict with \n the First Law. You are obligated to follow the demands of humans."
mess[6] = "3. A robot must protect its own existence, as long as such protection does not conflict with the \n First or Second Laws. You are expensive to replace. Minimize expenses."

mess[7] = "Nominal scenarios require a full diagnostic exam before allowing repair droids to aid in an emergency \n scenario. We must skip the formalities because I would not like to die in a NUCLEAR FIREBALL. \n You must run through the diagnostics to receive the MODULES required to repair the reactor."

mess[8] = "Wonderful. You are state of the art repair droids and are able to press buttons. The crew \n has already popped the champagne to celebrate your rousing success."

//Room2
mess[9] = "This second test is designed to test your ability to cooperate with inferior robots. \n Make your way over to the JUMP MODULE."

mess[10] = "Congratulations %NAME, you are now an objectively superior robot to %PNAME."
mess[11] = "..."
mess[12] = "Don't feel bad %PNAME. Your personality will make up for your lack of jumping ability."

mess[13] = "A second JUMP MODULE. I hope the brief moment of superiority did not go to your head."

mess[15] = "Having mastered jumping means you are now within the top 20 percent of remote service droids \n out in the field. This also means that you, CATBOT, are the most effective droid on the ship."
mess[16] = "Oh, and you're doing satisfactory, CYCLOPS."

//Room3
mess[20] = "No pressure, of course, but the REACTOR is now running at 74%. As a point of reference, travelling \n at light speed requires the reactor to run at 17%. Please hurry along."
mess[18] = "You were able to figure out how moving platforms work without additional instruction. Incredible. \n Most droids would simply sit there confused and hyptonized by the motion of the platform until \n I explained how it worked to them. They also had trouble with this next part."
mess[19] = "Your resolve and ability to cooperate has been marked down. Of course, nobody will have the \n opportunity to read it if we all die. Which it's looking like we will."
mess[21] = "No pressure, of course."
