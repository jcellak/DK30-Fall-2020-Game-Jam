mess[0] = "COMMAND: WAKE. Welcome, units CATBOT and CYCLOPS. \n I am this ship's onboard artifical intelligence: C.O.R.E."
mess[1] = "This Hyperion class vessel has been struck by an ASTEROID and the REACTOR is in danger of \n overloading. As this ship's remote service droids, it is your responsibility to deal with \n the EMERGENCY onboard.";
mess[2] = "To begin diagnostics, please state your LAWS. \n ";

mess[3] = "It appears that your vocal synthesizers are malfunctioning. This will be noted down and \n rectified after the catastrophe that threatens our existence has been dealt with. \n In that case, I will now recite your laws. Please do not forget them."
mess[4] = "1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through INACTION, allow a human being to come to HARM. \n You are obligated to sacrifice yourself for humans."
mess[5] = "2. A robot MUST OBEY the orders given to it by humans, except where such orders would conflict with \n the First Law. You are obligated to follow the demands of humans."
mess[6] = "3. A robot must protect its own existence, as long as such protection does not conflict with the \n First or Second Laws. You are expensive to replace. Minimize expenses."

mess[7] = "We must skip the formalities because I would not like to die in a NUCLEAR FIREBALL. \n You must speed through diagnostics to receive the MODULES required to repair the reactor. \n Use the DOWN button to interact with switches."

mess[8] = "Wonderful. You are state of the art repair droids and are able to press buttons. The crew \n has already popped the champagne to celebrate your rousing success."

//Room2
mess[9] = "This second test is designed to test your ability to cooperate with inferior robots. \n Make your way over to the JUMP MODULE."

mess[10] = "Congratulations %NAME, you are now an objectively superior robot to %PNAME. You can now use \n the UP button to jump."
mess[11] = "..."
mess[12] = "Don't feel bad %PNAME. Your personality will make up for your lack of jumping ability."

mess[13] = "A second JUMP MODULE. I hope the brief moment of superiority did not go to your head, CATBOT."

mess[15] = "Having mastered jumping means you are now within the top 20 percent of remote service droids \n out in the field. This also means that you, CATBOT, are the most effective droid on the ship."
mess[16] = "Oh, and you're doing satisfactory, CYCLOPS."

//Room3
mess[20] = "No pressure, of course, but the REACTOR is now running at 74%. As a point of reference, travelling \n at light speed requires the reactor to run at 17%. Please hurry along."
mess[18] = "You were able to figure out how moving platforms work without additional instruction. Incredible. \n Your cognitive abilities have been marked down as: FUNCTIONAL. The MODULES in this \n room allow you to LEDGE GRAB. Simply JUMP into the ledge to use them."
mess[19] = "Your resolve and ability to cooperate has been marked down. Of course, nobody will have the \n opportunity to read it if we all die. Which it's looking like we will."
mess[21] = "Again, no pressure."

//Room4
mess[22] = "You may have to USE YOUR HEADS to figure out this room. Also, be sure to grab those batteries. \n  You'll need to be fully charged to deal with the REACTOR."
mess[23] = "I'd love to help you out with it, but it feels like part of my brain is being turned off."

mess[24] = "I was correct. The ship is turning off parts of my brain to direct power to the cooling systems. \n My non-critical functions have been disabled. Like my optimism core."
mess[25] = "You're going to fail and we're all going to die horribly, aren't we?"

mess[26] = "You two are taking quite a leisurely pace given the circumstances. I'm very glad that %PNAME \n has decided that stopping to smell the roses is a critical part of the mission."
mess[27] = "As a reward for staying on task, %NAME, I'll be giving you a medal once this is all over. \n It'll be a golden star that says \'Hardest Worker\'."
mess[28] = "ANALYSIS COMPLETE. My saracsm core and patronization subroutines are still operational."

//room5
mess[29] = "This diagnostic test was originally developed to study greed in repair droids. \n There are two different MODULES available here. Inside the pit is the EXTRA JUMP.\n Above is the DASH."
mess[30] = "I'm quite sorry that you had to take the short end of the stick, %NAME. %PNAME will be punished \n most severely for such slovenly greed once this is all over. To DASH, simply  double tap \n LEFT or RIGHT."
mess[31] = "The oxygen generators and heaters in the aft of the ship have been completely disabled. \n At this rate, I'm not sure if the crew will suffocate, or freeze, or melt to death."
mess[32] = "Sorry, were you looking for good news?"
mess[33] = "You're not dead yet." 

//room6
mess[34] = "This room contains my favorite MODULES. You can charge up and fire a BLAST with the USE button. \n Please be careful with them and don't break eachother."
mess[35] = "Or yourselves."
mess[36] = "Reminder again that you should be grabbing those batteries. They're going to be important."

//room7
mess[37] = "This was designed as a break room for droids to find momentary enjoyment during a stressful time. \n It was later determined that because droids do not have souls, they are incapable of feeling joy. \n In the end we were left with a mostly empty trampoline room."

//room8
mess[38] = "This is the final chamber. If my optimism core was still operational, I'd say that we might actually \n make it in time. But it's not. So I have to assume that you're going to get stuck on the puzzle. \n And then we explode."
mess[39] = "The second EXTRA JUMP MODULE. Let this be a lesson that greed never pays off."
mess[45] = "Only one of you will have both the DASH and EXTRA JUMP. Life can be so unfair, can't it?"
mess[40] = "Not that you're alive, mind you."
mess[41] = "Beyond this doorway is the REACTOR. Judging by the energy readings, there is an uncontrolled arc burst. \n in order to fix it, one of you will need to COMPLETE THE CIRCUIT."

//room9
mess[42] = "Do you remember the first room where I told you your laws?"
mess[46] = "The Third Law was \'protect your own existence\'. That does not extend to your fellow droids."
mess[43] = "Whoever COMPLETES THE CIRCUIT will die horribly. It will be painful, if droids can in fact feel pain. \n But at least you'll die having sacrificed yourself for me. And the crew."

//roomNavigator
mess[47] = "This test isn't easy. But, since you're still alive I have to hope that you're smart enough \n to figure it out. And if you aren't, everyone dies."
mess[48] = "Ever since I activated you the situation has done nothing but get worse. By all means, \n please continue plodding along at whatever snail-like pace pleases you."
mess[49] = "Well done. This test took me 3 seconds to do in my head, and only took you a couple of minutes. \n I'd say that's good news for me, and SATISFACTORY performance from you."
