# DK30 Fall 2020 Game Jam (Working Title Still Pending)
Hey! This is the main README for the project. Start here if you need a reference point/how to get started.

Overview/summary of main software tools used recommended for development:
- GameMaker Studio 2
  - Our Main Development tool.
- GitKraken
  - A really nice Git GUI. It's free for public repositories! (which this is)
- TODO: More software, maybe for editing pixel art or Audacity (sound/music)

## 1. First-time Setup
Download the latest version of GameMaker Studio 2 here: https://www.yoyogames.com/get (free trial 30 days)
These instructions and files were created and tested specifically using IDE v2.3.0.529 and Runtime v2.3.0.401

GMS2 Trial Limitations: https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/230407528-GameMaker-Studio-2-Trial-Limitations
TL;DR: No significant restrictions besides inability to create final exectuables (at least one of us has a license so ask them to do it). Otherwise you should be able to compile on your local machine with impunity.

Download GitKraken here: https://www.gitkraken.com/ (or if you're feeling brave, just roll with Git command line)
Clone it someplace nice on your local machine, then in GMS2 open the .yyp project file in the root directory.

Hit F5 to run it and test it out. Start poking at it! TODO: More details here.

## 2. Development
More In-depth details about development tools and how we can use it to contribute to the project.

### 2.1. Aspect Ratio and Pixel Size
Target Aspect Ratio: `16:9`
Default Viewport: `1440x810`
Room Sizes Tested (i.e. Camera Resolution): `480x270`, `720x405`

If you want a different sized room but still want to be PIXEL PERFECT, use this handy chart:

If you use pixel sizes other than these (it will still work) the pixels will be distorted due to floating point calculations.

### 2.2. Software

#### 2.2.1. Game Maker Studio 2
TODO: Details

#### 2.2.2. GitKraken
GitKraken is pretty cool. TODO: How to use for people who don't use Git often.

### 2.3. Other Resources
If you want to contribute in other ways besides programming, here are some suggestions:
- Playtesting
- Sound effects and Music
  - Sound Effects generator: http://drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html 
  - Free Sound effects: https://freesound.org/
- Sprite Art (Pixel Art)
  - If you can make this, great! Otherwise there's a ton of royalty free options we can use out there.
  - https://opengameart.org/

## 3. Style Guides

### 3.1. GML (Game Maker Language)
Try to match existing structures and naming conventions if possible (i.e. if an object is named `oPlayer` then use `oEnemy`, if `o_player` then use `o_enemy`.)

Denote local variables starting with an underscore (i.e. `var _distance = 10;`)
